    <h2> About my Drone
    <h3> I have an HS110D drone made by Holy Stone.
     I have had this drone since I was only in 5th grade but after doing a few test runs, 
      it was clear that I should probably wait another year or so. I didn't end up 
    taking out that drone until 8th grade 2023. The reason I remembered about it was 
      beacause we had a school PBL (Project Based Learning) and It was about aircrafts
      specifically focusing on helicopters, planes, and drones. Anyway, I started to get
      a little excited and so one day after school, I went with my little brother to 
      go take it for a fly... </h3>
